            <h2>Narrative Tree Complexity Metric</h2>
            <p>I worked with a Psychology research group at the CUNY Grad Center to create a Complexity Metric for research on Interactive Digital Narrative. I used experts in the field to compare pairs of narrative trees, which were then used to create a hierarchy of tree complexities. This expert opinion was then modeled using supervised and unsupervised learning to create a model to assign a Narrative Tree Complexity Metric to new data. I will be a co-author on this paper and continue to work with the group on narrative tree research moving forward.</p>

            <h2>Magic: The Gathering Projects</h2>
            <p>
                As a lifelong fan of Moneyball and sports metrics, I saw an exciting opportunity to apply data analysis to Magic: The Gathering, a game recognized for its immense complexity and strategic depth. My investigations into this field are driven by a passion for uncovering insights from vast datasets and exploring areas that remain under-analyzed. According to a Technology Review article, Magic: The Gathering is hailed as the world's most complex game, making it a fascinating subject for data-driven exploration.

            <h2>Downsampling Audio (Electrical and Signal Engineering)</h2>
            <p>I am working with a friend to create a virtual instrument from thousands of audio recordings he collected from his Hammond B-3 organ. This is a report on a method I came up with to standardize the number of samples per second of the audio clips in order to remove a phasing issue we were having when the sounds were played together. This highlights my background and experience in electrical engineering and signal analysis.</p>
